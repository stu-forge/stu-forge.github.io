**Welcome** — and thanks for stopping by.

This blog is a place where ideas turn into real, tangible things. Sometimes that means copper traces and microcontrollers, sometimes aluminium chips on the workshop floor, and sometimes software quietly running on a server somewhere in the background.

I’ll be sharing ongoing projects, experiments, successes, failures, and lessons learned along the way — from custom-designed PCBs and embedded systems to CNC machining, metalworking, 3D printing, and home-built machines. You’ll also find posts about software development, IoT, Home Assistant integrations, networking, and running servers at home.

If you’re curious about who’s behind all this and what kind of projects are coming up, head over to the About page, where I explain things in more detail.

This is very much a hands-on blog. Expect schematics, code, CAD files, half-finished prototypes, and honest write-ups — not just polished end results.

Let’s build things...
