I build things — both in software and in the physical world.

My work and personal projects live at the intersection of electronics, mechanics, and code. I design and manufacture my own printed circuit boards, develop embedded systems from scratch, and write the firmware and software that bring them to life. From concept to finished device, I enjoy understanding and controlling the entire process.

On this site you’ll find projects such as:

*   **Custom PCBs** - Designed, manufactured, and assembled for specific purposes — often tightly integrated with custom firmware and enclosures.
    
*   **Embedded systems development** - Hardware design, low-level programming, and system-level thinking to create reliable, purpose-built devices.
    
*   **Instrument and tool design** - Measuring instruments, test equipment, and practical workshop tools designed to solve real problems.
    
*   **3D printing and product design** - Designing and manufacturing tools, enclosures, and everyday objects — functional first, but clean and considered.
    
*   **Metalworking and machining** - Turning, milling, and general metal fabrication. This also includes building machines themselves, such as CNC mills or even larger projects like injection moulding machines.
    
*   **Machine building** - From mechanical design to electronics and control systems — complete machines built from the ground up.
    
*   **Software development** - Tools, utilities, and custom software that supports hardware projects or stands on its own.
    
*   **IoT and Home Assistant** - Designing and building IoT devices, integrating them with Home Assistant, and creating systems that are reliable, local-first, and actually useful.
    
*   **Servers and networking** - Running and maintaining servers, experimenting with infrastructure ideas, and configuring network equipment for real-world use.
    

This blog is not about chasing trends or quick hacks. It’s about understanding how things work, building them properly, and learning by doing — even when that means mistakes, revisions, and redesigns.

There’s a reason the motto stuck: <br>
**Where metal meets microchips.**

Because the most interesting projects tend to happen right there — where mechanical parts, electronics, and software all have to work together as one.

If that sounds like your kind of thing, you’re in the right place.
